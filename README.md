# Word Embedding with Linear Model

This project demonstrates a simple word embedding model using PyTorch. The model uses linear transformations to map words to vector embeddings and is trained to predict the next word in a sequence. The project also includes visualization of the word embeddings before and after training.

## Files

1. **WordEmbedding.py**: Contains the `WordEmbeddingWithLinear` class and the `plot_embeddings` function. This file defines the model architecture, training procedure, and visualization methods.
2. **main.py**: The main script that prepares the data, trains the model, and plots the embeddings before and after training.

## Dependencies

- PyTorch
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib

## Installation

Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed. You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install torch pandas seaborn matplotlib
